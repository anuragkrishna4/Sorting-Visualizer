# Sorting-Visualizer
Sorting Visualizer is a web-based tool that helps users understand and visualize various sorting algorithms in action. It dynamically generates an array of bars representing numbers and sorts them step by step, using animations to illustrate how each algorithm works. This interactive tool is useful for students, educators, and anyone interested in learning sorting techniques.

With Sorting Visualizer, you can:

Select from multiple sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort).
Adjust the array size and sorting speed for a customized experience.
See real-time animations demonstrating how elements are swapped and sorted.
Gain a better understanding of sorting time and space complexities.
